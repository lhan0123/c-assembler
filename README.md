# Introduction

This project is part of the System Programming Language course at Chung Yuan Christian University (CYCU). The goal is to convert a file written in x86 assembly language into machine code. The implementation is structured into several steps: (1) Lexical Analysis: Convert high-level language commands into a sequence of tokens. (2) Token Grouping: Group tokens into a token group, such as label, opcode, operand, and execute syntax checks. (3) Symbol Table Construction: Construct a symbol table to convert the assembly language into binary code.
